            <h3>What people are say:</h3>
            <div>
                <p>I'm using @logseq + @obsdmd! Logseq is an outliner + task management that works well with my "18,000
                    things at once" daily way of thinking. It's also connected to Obsidian, where I keep my longer term
                    research that benefits from structured documents.</p>
                <p>Freaking *loving* @logseq since I started using it on the desktop.
                    Mashup of roam and org-mode's task management is making me very happy so far, even in 0.0.13. Super
                    impressed as giving me all the things I like about roam, emacs org-mode, and notion together.</p>
                <p>Every time I use @logseq I'm thinking, I needed this years ago. And the gleefully look at a future
                    where I had this for years.
                </p>
                <p>Ok, I'm having an absolute BLAST using @logseq for my DevLog and Tech notes that need more structure
                    and organization. </p>
